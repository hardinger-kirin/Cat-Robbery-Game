# Cat-Robbery-Game
This is the first game project in my CS 328 - Fundamentals of Game Design class in the Fall 2022 semester at the University of Nevada Reno.

In this game, you play as a cat who intimidates and robs innocent people of their coins. You spend coins at the market to earn fish! Collect enough fish, and you will be lucky enough to survive the night.

Step 1: finished September 19. Very bare bones, core gameplay mechanic only.

Step 2: finished September 26. Some sound effects, music, smoother gameplay and better graphics.

Step 3: finished October 3. Final version!

To execute:
Download the zip folder and extract. Run "Cat Robbery". Note that all builds are only for Windows systems!

Thank you :)
